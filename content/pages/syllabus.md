Course Meeting Times
--------------------

Lectures: Two sessions / week, 1.5 hours / session

Course Overview
---------------

This course covers fundamentals of subsurface flow and transport, emphasizing the role of groundwater in the hydrologic cycle, the relation of groundwater flow to geologic structure, and the management of contaminated groundwater. The course will cover the following topics: Darcy equation, flow nets, mass conservation, the aquifer flow equation, heterogeneity and anisotropy, storage properties, regional circulation, unsaturated flow, recharge, stream-aquifer interaction, well hydraulics, flow through fractured rock, numerical models, groundwater quality, contaminant transport processes, dispersion, decay, and adsorption. It includes laboratory and computer demonstrations, and is a core requirement for Environmental and Geoenvironmental M.Eng. program.

Course Requirements
-------------------

### Assignments

Assignments will be due either one or two weeks after they are handed out depending on their length. Grades will be reduced 10% for each day late.

### Exams

In-class midterm and a final exam.
